Responses for this week
1. Using The Wayback Macine I decided to go back in time to view Apple.com in August 2002. 

2. The design of the webpage is completely different now, as should be expected. The layout, menu options, images, and videos feel more modern and user friendly. The aesthetics of the website in modern times is very streamlined and less boxy than it was 2002.

            <p>
                Photography has always found its way into Derik's life. His passion for photography really developed while deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq while serving in the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Photography was a way to capture memories, relieve boredom, and act as a distraction. After being discharged in 2010, Derik spent time taking photographs of his motorcycle and hotrod projects, constantly looking for different angles to provide emphasis on the subject. Fast forward a few years into the drone age and Derik was again composing photographs from different angles and mnauevering his drone into places not easily accessible by photographers on foot.

                His love for drone photography got him started with a degree program at Embrey-Riddle Aeronautical University in the Unmanned Systems degree program. Derik found this to be an interesting degree field; however, it wouldn't supply him with the tools to post edit and deep dive into the digital side of things after flight. Derik now attends the University of Montana and is actively working on his BA in Media Arts where he has taken formal photography classes.

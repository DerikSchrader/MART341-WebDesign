1. My experience using HTML this sesmster has been a positive experience with a lot of knowledge learned. My previous experience with writing code in html was frustrating and really turned me away from any sort of coding. The majority of information that was presented during this first portion has been relatively new, or I didn't retain much from my last experience. This class has been interesting and I appreciate how its been presented in a manner that's easy to follow.

2. When it comes to CSS I can't think of any aspect that really stands out to be excited about. Im excited to dive into it and learn more about actually decorating sites and continuing with how this information is is being instructed.

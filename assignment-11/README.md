1. What is typography? Typography is the art, or maybe science, of styling and arranging letters to achieve a desired visual outcome.

2. Its important to have fallback fonts because browsers may not be able to read certain typefaces and will need a fallback inorder to ensure the end user can read the content.

3. The diffrence between system, web, and web-safe fonts is based on hosting location and compatability. System fonts are ones that are stored on your local device and system. These fonts are not meant for logo or web use and should be used sparingly. Web fonts are custom and hosted on a server and are designed for the web. Finally, web-safe fonts are ones that developers can count on being available for both Mac and Windows OS.

1. The difference between padding, margins, and borders is:
 Borders, unlike margins and padding are really meant as more of a styling aid that define the amount of space an element takes up. Padding defines teh space between the inner part/content of the element and the element itself. Margins are the space between the box element and other elements.

 2. This week's assignemnt had some hurdles to get over. I ran into issues where previous CSS was conflicting. but was easily overcome once I realized what was going on. The second issue I had was the drop down menu. WHen attempting to hover over the top of the hidden area the box would disappear. The slightest gap between the menu item drop down was causing the computer to lose visibility and the box would close. I FINALLY overcame this by incerasing the padding and closing the gap.
